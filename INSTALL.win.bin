--- 'MPICH2' Installation:
   Download 'MPICH2' from 'http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/'.
   'mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-ia32.msi' for 32 bits and
   'mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-x86-64.msi' for 64 bits.
   Click it and install them to the default directory

   - 64-bits: 'C:\Program Files\MPICH2'.
   - 32-bits: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\MPICH2'.


--- Set environment variables:
   Suppose 'R' and 'MPICH2' are all installed by default. I have a batch
   file 'set_mpi.bat' as the following to set the environment variables.
   In short, 'MPI_ROOT' should be set to 'mpiexec.exe', and added to 'PATH'.

@ECHO OFF
SET R_HOME=C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.1
SET MPI_ROOT=C:\Program Files\MPICH2
IF NOT DEFINED PATH_ORG SET PATH_ORG=%PATH%
SET PATH=%R_HOME%;%R_HOME%\BIN\;%MPI_ROOT%\BIN\;%PATH_ORG%


--- Test 'MPICH2':
   In order to test if 'MPICH2' works correctly, I run

     C:/> set_mpi
     C:/> mpiexec -np 2 hostname.exe

   and this should list two host names if environment variables are
   correct. User id and password may be required to launch 'MPICH2'.


--- 'pbdMPI' Installation:
   Default Installation:

     C:/> set_mpi
     C:/> R CMD INSTALL pbdMPI_0.1-0.zip


--- Test 'pbdMPI':
   Suppose all environments are set correctly, I can run test examples by

     C:/> set_mpi
     C:/> mpiexec -np 2 Rscript.exe -e "library(pbdMPI);init();finalize()"
