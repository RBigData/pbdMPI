--- 'OpenMPI' Installation:
   Obtain 'OpenMPI' from 'http://www.open-mpi.org/'

     > tar zxvf openmpi-1.5.4.tar.gz
     > cd openmpi-1.5.4
     > ./configure
     > ./make
     > ./make install

   These install files to '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/lib', and
   '/usr/local/include' etc.  i.e. ${MPI_ROOT} is '/usr/local'.


--- Set environment variables:
   For 'csh' or 'tcsh', I would set

     > setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
     > setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   For 'sh', 'bash', or 'ksh', I would set

     > export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
     > export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   - 'PATH' is to make sure I can run 'mpiexec', 'mpirun', or 'orterun'.
   - 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' is to make sure I can reach 'libmpi.so'.

   *** The other way is to modify '/etc/ld.so.conf' and to use the command
       'ldconfig' to update the system searhing path for 'libmpi.so'.


--- Test 'OpenMPI':
   In order to test if 'OpenMPI' works correctly, I simply run

     > mpiexec -np 2 hostname

   and this should show host name twice if environment variables are correct.


--- 'pbdMPI' Installation:
0. Download and extract 'pbdMPI'

     > tar zxvf pbdMPI_0.1-0.tar.gz

1. Default Installation:
   This should work with most platforms with 'OpenMPI' installed. The
   configuration is based on 'Rmpi' but detect the flags and libraries from
   'mpicc --showme:*' which is more portable.

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdMPI

2. Non-default Installation:

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdMPI \
     +   --configure-args="--with-Rmpi-type=OPENMPI \
     +                     --with-mpi=/usr/local"

3. Unusual Installation:
   Suppose 'PATH' and 'LD_LIBRARY_ATH' are set, but I don't use default paths
   to header files and libraries, then I can install 'pbdMPI' by

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdMPI \
     +   --configure-args="--with-Rmpi-type=OPENMPI \
     +                     --with-Rmpi-include=/usr/local/ompi/include  \
     +                     --with-Rmpi-libpath=/usr/local/ompi/lib" \

   Note that I still need 'PATH' and 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' to be set correctly in
   this case.


--- Test 'pbdMPI':
   Suppose 'PATH' and 'LD_LIBRARY_ATH' are set correctly, I can run test
   examples by

     > cd pbdMPI/inst/examples/test_spmd/
     > ./00_test_all.sh
