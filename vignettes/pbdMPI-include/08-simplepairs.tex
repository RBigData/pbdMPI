We build some pairwise evaluation utilities for pairwise evaluation to
\pkg{pbdMPI} since version 0.2-3.

Evaluating a function on any two data points is a common problems, such as
distance, pairwise comparison, and multiple testing problems.
Useful functions to those problems are
\begin{itemize}
\item
\code{comm.as.gbd()}:
This function is to turn a common matrix (in all ranks)
to a gbd matrix in row major blocks. For example, one may read in data
from one rank, then utilizes this function to redistribute data. This is
an alternative way to Section~\ref{sec:simple_io}, but only efficient for
small size of data.

\item
\code{comm.allpairs()}:
This function is mainly to provide ids for all pairs of any $N$ data points.
It returns a two columns (i, j)  gbd matrix in row major blocks.
For example, one may want to evaluate all $N^2$ pairs of the $N$ data points.
However, in distance context, it provides only indices as in lower-triangular
matrix.

\item
\code{comm.dist()}:
This function is to compute distance (lower-triangular only) of $N$ data points
as usual \code{dist()} function, but evaluated on a gbd matrix in row major
blocks. The returning can be a common distance matrix (only good for small
dataset), or a 3 columns gbd matrix in row major blocks. The columns are
i, j, and the value of pair (i, j).

\item
\code{comm.pairwise()}:
This functions is a general extension of above three functions that allows
users to provide a function \code{FUN} to evaluate on pairs of data.
For example, a distance between two data points \code{x} and \code{y}
can be computed via original \code{dist()} function. So, it can be wrapped as
\begin{Code}
dist.pair <- function(x, y, ...){
  as.vector(dist(rbind(x, y), ...))
}
\end{Code}
for the \code{FUN} option of \code{comm.pairwise()}.
This function is useful for cases that distance of pair (i, j)
differs to that of pair (j, i). If order is matter, then the \code{FUN}
can is evaluated via the options either \code{pairid.gbd}
which can be user defined or simply \code{symmetric = FALSE}.
\end{itemize}

Also, we provide some toy examples in man page. A demo verifies these
functions in different ways.
\begin{Command}
### Run the demo with 4 processors by
mpiexec -np 4 Rscript -e "demo(simple_pairs,'pbdMPI',ask=F,echo=F)"
\end{Command}
See \pkg{pbdDEMO} vignettes~\citep{Schmidt2013pbdDEMOvignette}
