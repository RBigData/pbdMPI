Description: A simplified, efficient, interface to MPI for HPC clusters. It is
        a derivation and rethinking of the Rmpi package that embraces the
        prevalent parallel programming style on HPC clusters. It is based on S4
        classes and methods. 
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Linux, Mac, and
        FreeBSD. MS-MPI (Microsoft MPI v7.1 (SDK) and Microsoft HPC
