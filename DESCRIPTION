Description: pbdMPI provides an efficient interface to MPI by utilizing S4
        classes and methods with a focus on Single Program/Multiple Data (SPMD)
        parallel programming style, which is intended for batch parallel
        execution.
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Solaris, Linux, Mac, and
        FreeBSD. MS-MPI (Microsoft HPC Pack 2012 R2 MS-MPI
